# A gentle intro to GPUs
> This aims to give you a bit of history about the GPU itself, why we use it for deep learning tasks, why its way faster than the CPU at certain tasks.

## Hardware
- CPU: Central Processing Unit
    - General purpose
    - High clock speed
    - Few cores
    - High cache
    - Low Latency
    - Low throughput

- GPU: Graphics Processing Unit
    - Specialized
    - Low clock speed
    - Many cores
    - Low cache
    - High Latency
    - High throughput

- TPU: Tensor Processing Unit
    - Specialized GPUs for deep learning algorithms (matrix multiplication, etc)

- FPGA: Field Programmable Gate Array
    - Specialized hardware that can be reconfigured to perform specific tasks
    - Very low latency
    - Very high throughput
    - Very high power consumption
    - Very high cost
